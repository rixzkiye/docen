// The canvas route's editing base — a viewless Tiptap editor (element: null)
// driving the layout pipeline. The PM state is the single source of truth:
// every transaction re-flows the document (raf-merged) and the stage
// repaints; no DOM render of the doc exists at all. Text input arrives
// through an invisible textarea bridge — the canvas owns the visual surface,
// the textarea owns the browser's keyboard/IME machinery, and beforeinput
// events translate to state transactions. The view Proxy Tiptap installs for
// element:null supports command dispatch (insertContentAt/deleteRange), but
// anything touching real view internals (focus(), someProp via
// captureTransaction) crashes — so every translation here goes through pure
// PM state commands.
